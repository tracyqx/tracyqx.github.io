I though I learned a lot in this semester.\r\n    I am pretty impressed on project we had finished. \r\n    First of all , I learned how to use GNU Debugger in linux, which I had never know before. I used VS for programming in the past.\r\n    Secondly, I learned lots of algorithm  I never knew before, which was pretty import for a programmer. And I realized that I need learned more about algorithm so I decide to take algorithm design course in next semester.\r\n    The first project is Markovian-tweets. I try some new function in C++ such as map[],pop_front(),push_back(). We met lots of difficulties in project 1, and finally we just finished layer 1. In project 2, I learned chain table, defining, creating, reading and changing. I finish polynomial adding but I can not do multiplication because I cannot correct number of terms. \r\n    Finally, I finished with help of my partners.\r\n    In project 3, I finished a simple game: Minesweeper. In this project I know about random generation and understand algorithm. I didn't know how to lay mine, then I searched for lots of materials online and then I set mines where random number is 9. And if user finish clicking all the coordinate without mines, the user win the game.\r\n    The last project, geemail, I learned to encrypt and decrypt using SHA256 sala20 etc. and use sqlite3 connecting C++.\r\n    This project might be a little difficult for me. Although I and my partners didn't finished it in C++. We also learned much from that. I know more about encrypt, which is very import to be a security programmer.\r\n### How to apply what I learned to reality\r\nThe purpose of study is to make the world better, so does programming. Nowadays, with the development of information time, cyber security had increasingly attracted public attention. To be honest, I know nearly nothing about related field. But now I know how to encrypt massage in code, protecting massage from being attacked by hackers. The most obvious application is mail login and massage extraction. Some other system need more stable encryption such as individual information in bank, which is essential for protect everyone today. So I think I can use what I learned to make the world better \r\n",
